Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a client-focused company dedicated to developing multi-user gaming experiences. They wanted to port their game, Draw It or Lose It, for which they originally developed an Android version, to other platforms for this project. The primary needs were performance, scalability, and the ability to support multiple concurrent sessions of the game while efficiently managing resources across distributed environments.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

One of my strengths was action-oriented, step-by-step design procedures to demystify the complex requirements of the customer. I ensured that every aspect of the software was addressed in a step-by-step fashion, the development process was given accurate guidance, and other team members were allowed to follow and make returns in return.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

This design document process enabled me to structure the architecture, consider edge cases, and anticipate integration problems before starting to code. Having such a detailed document reduces confusion and provides a roadmap for pursuing the project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part, I would improve the section detailing user authentication and authorization. I would add more diagrams and step-by-step user flow scenarios to ensure robust security and a seamless experience for all users.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I preferred the end-user experience and how they would use the game, with the informed design decision in mind. This was done to ensure a fluid player experience and simplify memory handling, allowing for a design interface that is readable and easy to use. The user should take precedence because it leads to more intuitive, accessible, and successful software.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I employed a formal, step-by-step technique—starting with requirements gathering, accompanied by iterative layout, and ordinary opinions with stakeholders. In the future, I will continue to utilize dependent documentation, early prototyping, and continuous feedback loops to ensure that improvements stay on course to meet consumer and personal expectations.
